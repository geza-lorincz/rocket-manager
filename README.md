# rocket-manager

This project was created by Geza Lorincz for the Lunar Backend Engineer Challenge. The service is responsible for receiving and processing rocket state updates. It uses Kotlin with Ktor and is designed to handle JSON messages related to rocket state changes. The service processes these updates and forwards them to the relevant destinations.

## Requirements
Before you can build and run the service, make sure you have the following tools installed:
- Java 17 (or newer)
- Gradle (or use the Gradle wrapper ./gradlew)
- Kotlin 1.8+

## Getting started
### 1. Clone the repository

### 2. Build the project using Gradle
```bash
./gradlew build
```
### 3. Run the service locally
```bash
./gradlew run
```

### 4. Access endpoints
The service should now be running
